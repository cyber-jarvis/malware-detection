# Malware Detection

We have used machine learning techniques to classify malware in this project. 

## Dataset Construction

We have collected data from 
```
VirusShare
Kaggle
Any source for genuine files
```
## Algorithms used

We have used ```K-Nearest Neighbour```, ```Random Forest``` and ```XGBoost``` Algorithms to train our model. Stacking technique is used for better prediction.

## Installing Dependencies

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install pickle5
pip install matplotlib
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install joblib
pip install xgboost
```
## Running an example

First change the permissions of the files ```train.py```, ```detect.py``` and ```extract_csv.py```

to train with the training set, use: 
```
./train.py           
```

test csv file                  :
```
./detect.py -c ./Data/dataset_test.csv
```
detect for a single file       :
```
./detect.py -f path/to/file
```
detect malware in a directory  : 
```
./detect.py -d path/to/directory
```
Extract data from raw binary file into a ```csv``` file using :
```
./extract_csv -[Type|Class|Mode] <path/to/source/folder> <path/to/destination/file>

Type  : Type of the data to be extracted (training data / testing data).
        By default it is set as testing data, use option [-t] to set it to training data.
Class : In which class does the data belong to? Ignored if extracting testing data.
        Use option [-m] if extracting 'malware' data and [-c] otherwise.
        By default it is set to [-m].
Mode  : Mode to store the data in destination file [write (w)/append (a)].
```
Here is one example usage :
```
./extract_to_csv -tmw ./exe/ ./Data/malware_data.csv
```
